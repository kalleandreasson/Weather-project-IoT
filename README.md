IoT project with a DHT11 sensor
Pico-W-Stub that is created when you configure your project on pico is gitignored. 

Hello! my name is Kalle Andreasson (ka223ey). I have made a IoT project that sends the temperature and humidity to Adafruit from a Raspberry pico. The temperature and humidity is collected with a sensor called DHT11. I have also set a thresh hold on 25 degrees, If the temperature is above 25 degrees then I will also upload that to adafruit but in a different feed. If you are completely new to IoT this project might take a couple of weeks, this was my second project within IoT and it took me 3-4 weeks. 

I chose this project because I already had some of the hardware at home and the project seemed to be fairly simple and fun to do, so I thought it would be a good beginner project. The purpose of my project is to read the temperature and humidity then upload it to a cloud service called Adafruit were i visualize it with graphs
